INCOMPETENT. WON'T FOLLOW THROUGH WITH SETTING APPOINTMENTS.

Summary:

I drove a close friend 1.5 hrs. to Palo Verde on 27 February 2022 for strong suicidal ideations and a major depressive episode. Palo Verde decided to do IOP (Intensive Out-Patient) instead of in-patient. Today is 15 March. They still haven't started IOP with this person. Palo Verde doesn't follow through, and is incompetent. They said they called the patient's insurance. They didn't. They said they signed up this person to begin IOP today, 15 March. They didn't.

Details:

I drove a close friend 1.5 hrs to Palo Verde on 27 Feb. 2022 for expected in-patient treatment due to suicidal ideations and a major depressive episode. After evaluation, they decided *not* to do in-patient treatment. This was acceptable with me and my friend. Instead, they said they would immediately begin IOP (Intensive Out-Patient) treatment. It is 15 March now, 16 days later, AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T. I'M PISSED OFF AT THE INCOMPETENCY OF THIS CRAPPY ORGANIZATION.

The entire week following that 1.5 hr drive in, from 28 Feb. to 4 March, we followed up repeatedly and they said they were still waiting on the patient's insurance to agree to cover IOP services. I finally called my friend's insurance with my friend around 4 March and the insurance said PALO VERDE HAD NEVER CONTACTED THEM, and that if Palo Verde does, the insurance will do same-day approval. I immediately called Palo Verde and told them they had never contacted the insurance, and they said they didn't know what happened, but they'd sign us up immediately for the next available IOP slot, which was scheduled to begin 15 March. That was acceptable with us and I was pleased with that result.

Today, however, is 15 March. We have received no email, no sign-up information, nothing regarding IOP. So, it has been **16 days** and we still don't have IOP started.

If you have a suicidal friend or someone close to you, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE where they may actually have people who are competent and care, so your loved one can get treatment. Palo Verde doesn't seem to be very organized and may not schedule you when you need it most, even after they say repeatedly they will.
